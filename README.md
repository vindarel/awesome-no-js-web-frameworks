# (Possibly awesome) Web frameworks solving the Javascript problem

Because writing a web project with two languages is frustrating,
specially with Javascript.


We'll list here isomorphic web frameworks, that allow to write an
interactive web app without resorting to Javascript. Bonus point to
the ones not using JS libraries and not separating back and front
code.

Directly inspired by [https://wiki.haskell.org/The_JavaScript_Problem](https://wiki.haskell.org/The_JavaScript_Problem).

## Clojure & ClojureScript

! heavily uses the JS ecosystem (specially React).


! Clojure and ClojureScript are two different things.

- [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/), ...


## Common Lisp

### CLOG

[CLOG](https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog) - The Common Lisp Omnificent GUI. Uses web technology to produce graphical user interfaces for applications locally or remotely.

- CLOG is based on the ideas of GNOGA, a framework the author wrote for Ada and used in commercial production code since 2013.
- many tutorials

### ISSR

[Interactive SSR](https://github.com/interactive-ssr/client/blob/master/main.org/) - ISSR allows you to make interactive web pages without writing client scripting. No knowledge about Javascript or DOM is necessary.
  - it is not unlike Phoenix LiveView or Hotwire.
- tutorial: http://cjackson.tk/todo-tutorial

### Weblocks

- tutorial: http://40ants.com/weblocks/quickstart.html ([sources](https://github.com/40ants/weblocks/blob/reblocks/docs/source/quickstart.rst))
- can fallback to full http without ajax
- production example: https://ultralisp.org/
- other examples: [cl-torrents-web](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents-web/)
- [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/40ants/weblocks)

> With Weblocks, you can handle all the business logic server-side,
> because an action can be any lisp function, even an anonymous
> lambda, closuring all necessary variables.

Components-based like React, but server based.

**Editor's note**: it allows to keep the same CL development
experience all the way. Very lightweight. We can keep the state of the
application between changes.

## Elixir

### Drab

- website and examples: https://tg.pl/drab
- https://github.com/grych/drab
- another library with similar goals is about to be published ([LiveView](https://shift.infinite.red/phoenixs-liveview-client-side-elixir-at-last-2280716ae791), as of september 2018).

> Drab is the extension library to Phoenix Framework for providing an access to the browser's User Interface (DOM objects) from the server side. The main advantage is to eliminate necessity of writing two applications: one for the client-side, and one for the backend. All the UI control may be now done in the backend, eliminating JS and AJAX.

Example:Â simple html on the client side:

```html
<form>
  <input name="text_to_uppercase" value="<%= @text %>">
  <button drab="click:uppercase">Upcase</button>
  <button drab="click:downcase">Downcase</button>
</form>
```

Drab does not GET or POST the form, it calls the event handler
function via websockets instead, and updates the DOM nodes directly on
the page. Clicking the button does not reload the page.

 In this example, the `click` event in the browser remotely runs
 `DrabPoc.LiveCommander.uppercase/2` on the server:

~~~elixir
defmodule DrabPoc.LiveCommander do
  use Drab.Commander

  defhandler uppercase(socket, sender) do
    text = sender.params["text_to_uppercase"]
    poke socket, text: String.upcase(text)
  end
end
~~~

After processing the inputs, we need to present it to back in the
browser. This is where we use `poke/2` function - it pushes the assign
(in this case: `<%= @text %>`) back to the browser. Input value is
updated, without reloading the page.

### Phoenix LiveView

- https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript

> Phoenix LiveView is an exciting new library which enables rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. LiveView powered applications are stateful on the server with bidrectional communication via WebSockets, offering a vastly simplified programming model compared to JavaScript alternatives.

- uses nodejs.

## Go

- https://go.isomorphicgo.org/ (no docs, they are in a book)
- example: http://igweb.kamesh.com/

Uses the [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) transpiler.

## Haskell

[https://wiki.haskell.org/The_JavaScript_Problem](https://wiki.haskell.org/The_JavaScript_Problem)

### Haste

- https://haste-lang.org/docs/
- examples: https://github.com/valderman/haste-compiler/blob/master/examples/

## Haxe

- https://haxe.org

> Haxe is an open source high-level strictly-typed programming language with a fast optimizing cross-compiler. Haxe can build cross-platform applications targeting JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash and allows access to each platform native capabilities. Haxe has its own VMs (HashLink and NekoVM) but can also run in interpreted mode.

Web frameworks:

- https://github.com/ufront/ufront
- http://hexmachina.org
- real-world examples: ?

Example: [ufront hello world](https://github.com/ufront/hello/blob/master/HelloWorld.hx).

```
class HelloWorld {
	static function main() {
		#if server
			// Initialise the app on the server and execute the request.
			var ufApp = new UfrontApplication({
				indexController: HelloWorldController,
				defaultLayout: "layout.html"
			});
			#if (php || neko)
				ufApp.executeRequest();
			#elseif nodejs
				ufApp.listen();
			#end
		#elseif client
			// Initialise the app on the client and respond to "pushstate" requests as a single-page-app.
			var clientApp = new ClientJsApplication({
				indexController: HelloWorldController,
				defaultLayout: "layout.html"
			});
			clientApp.listen();
		#end
	}
}
```

Example: [HexMachina Flickr gallery](https://github.com/DoclerLabs/hexMachina-Gallery-Classical-MVC/).

## Nim

### Karax

>  Single page applications for Nim.

- https://github.com/pragmagic/karax
- production example: https://forum.nim-lang.org/. [github](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimforum).

## Ocaml

### Eliom

- http://ocsigen.org/eliom/
- allows continuations based web programming
- targets web browsers and mobile devices (iOs, Android)
- production example: https://www.besport.com/

> Eliom is a multi-tier framework for developing multi-platform Web and mobile apps. It transforms OCaml into a multi-tier language: It makes it possible to write modern distributed applications fully in OCaml, for both the server and client parts, which simplifies a lot the communication between server and client. Applications are written as single programs that can run on any Web browser or mobile device (iOS, Android), saving from the need to develop one version for each platform.
>
> Eliom has support for reactive pages (generated on server or client), advanced session mechanism, server to client communication, continuation based Web programming, etc.
>
> It can also be used for more traditional Web or mobile apps: server only, single page applications, REST API, etc.

Excerpt from the [tutorial](https://ocsigen.org/tuto/6.1/manual/tutowidgets):

The following code defines a client-server Web application with only one service, registered at URL / (the root of the website).

The code also defines a client-side application (section [%%client ... ] ) that appends a client-side generated widget to the page. Section [%%shared ... ] is compiled on both the server and the client-side programs. Inside such a section, you can write let%server or let%client to override [%%shared ... ] and define a server-only or client-only value (similarly for [%%server ... ] and [%%client ... ] ).

```ocaml
module Ex_app =
  Eliom_registration.App (struct
    let application_name = "ex"
    let global_data_path = None
  end)

let _ = Eliom_content.Html.D.(
  Ex_app.create
    ~path:(Eliom_service.Path [""])
    ~meth:(Eliom_service.Get Eliom_parameter.unit)
    (fun () () ->
       Lwt.return
         (Eliom_tools.D.html ~title:"tutowidgets" ~css:[["css"; "ex.css"]]
            (body [h2 [pcdata "Welcome to Ocsigen!"]])))
)

[%%client
let mywidget s1 s2 = Eliom_content.Html.D.(
  let button  = div ~a:[a_class ["button"]] [pcdata s1] in
  let content = div ~a:[a_class ["content"]] [pcdata s2] in
  div ~a:[a_class ["mywidget"]] [button; content]
)

let _ =
  let%lwt _ = Lwt_js_events.onload () in
  Dom.appendChild
    (Dom_html.document##.body)
    (Eliom_content.Html.To_dom.of_element (mywidget "Click me" "Hello!"));
  Lwt.return ()
]
```

The `##` is used to call a JS method from OCaml and `##.` to access a
JS object field.

`Lwt` is the concurrent library used to program threads on both client
and server sides. The syntax `let%lwt a = e1 in e2` allows waiting
(without blocking the rest of the program) for an Lwt thread to
terminate before continuing. `e2` must ben a Lwt thread
itself. `Lwt.return` enables creating an already-terminated Lwt thread.
`Lwt_js_events` defines a convenient way to program interface events
(mouse, keyboard, ...).

`Lwt_js_events.onload` is a Lwt thread that waits until the page is
loaded. There are similar functions to wait for other events, e.g.,
for a click on an element of the page, or for a key press.


**Editor's note**: quite some work to install, compile and deploy.

## PHP

### Livewire

- https://github.com/livewire/livewire

> A full-stack framework for Laravel that takes the pain out of building dynamic UIs.

- documentation: https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/quickstart

- 9k+ stars

## Python

### Anpylar

- https://www.anpylar.com/
- uses [Brython](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython), an
  implementation of Python 3 running in the browser.

> [me] Reminds me of Nagare.
>
> [Anpylar team] AnPyLar has gone a step beyond by being client-side. One of the advantages is that the application is downloaded once, and can contain multiple pages and hierarchies, which are navigated without sending a single request to the server.
>
> The server can with it be a pure API server (and the server of the initial content download), with the advantage of no longer having to implement business logic in the server.


### Nagare

- http://www.nagare.org/
- based on Stackless Python
- allows continuations based web programming
- [production examples](http://www.nagare.org/trac/wiki/WhoUsesNagare),
  [Kansha](http://www.kansha.org/), open-source Trello clone.

**Editor's note**: looks like ASP .Net. Doesn't seem totally JavaScript free:

```python
@presentation.render_for(Board, 'switch')
def render_Board_item(self, h, comp, *args):
    reload_search = ajax.Update(component_to_update='show_results',
                                render=lambda renderer: comp.render(renderer, 'search_results'))
    h << h.script(u'''$(window).on('reload_search', function() { %s; })''' % reload_search.generate_action(41, h))

    with h.div(id='switch_zone'):
        if self.model == 'columns':
            search_cb = ajax.Update(
                action=self.search,
                component_to_update='show_results',
                render=lambda renderer: comp.render(renderer, 'search_results')
            ).generate_action(1, h).replace('this', 'elt')
            oninput = 'debounce(this, function(elt) { %s; }, 500)' % search_cb
            # etc
```

> a list of libraries for creating web applications that handle user interaction with the DOM on the server. These libraries take a different approach from older server-driven browser UIs that simulated a desktop GUI toolkit. They do not lock the developer into working with predefined components; they operate at the level of HTML (DOM) rather than GUI widgets.
